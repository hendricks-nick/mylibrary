api queries with multiple author name,or title words require some scrubbing. 
example - query is lord of the rings, it need to structured as:
q=intitle:lord+intitle:of+intitle:the+intitle:rings

need a function to handle that. lower vs uppercase doesn't matter.

need an error handling option as well for not existant request, example isbn:1234
